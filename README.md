# Blocks Pattern

This project is built using Angular 7 / Angular Material, Flex Layout, HTML5, CSS3. It displays a pattern of blocks based on the user Input. The user will input the total number of blocks and the total number of blocks needed per row.

The application will create a pattern based on the user Input. The user can click on the block to change the colour of the block. Proper CSS Styling is used to design the block which creates a beautiful blocks pattern.

This game is really fun to play to create different patterns based on the user input.
